# Argument Hasher: a toy sample

ZK verifiers spend gas for each public input its delivered. It costs around 6k gas for each public provided on the verifier call function

This is where it gets so expensive.
```
for (uint i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    require(input[i] < snark_scalar_field,"verifier-gte-snark-scalar-field");
    vk_x = Pairing.addition(vk_x, Pairing.scalar_mul(vk.IC[i + 1], input[i]));
}
```

Due to this characteristic, it might be beneficial for a protocol to hash its inputs before sending them to the verifier, and providing only a hash of the inputs as a public input.

This adds complexity to the circuit, as, also for gas optimization purposes (according to Roman Semenov. Need to test to make sure), we use a SHA256 hash instead of a more circuit friendly hash function like poseidon or MIMC.

This repo is a simple contract and its respective tests in order to make sure everything is working the same both on chain and on the js/ts side

setup circuit by running `sh setup_compile_and_prove`. ItÂ´ll generate a contracts/Verifier.sol, but the test will use a hardcoded proof right now. Need to copy calldata manually.

run contract locally using truffle

```
truffle develop
> test
```
